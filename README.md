Interactive Draw Tools
=======================

These tools allow you to create objects interactively in Blender.

## Note
This script is set to run in blender 2.75 or higher, but MAY run on lower versions of the 2.5 strain if all references to `self.curve_data.splines.active` are commented out.  There was previously a bug that crashed blender when you tried to set this variable.
